<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This is an interdisciplinary book aimed at senior level undergraduate mathematics students. The common thread throughout the book is a type of tiling, of which the best known example is the &#x0201C;kite and dart&#x0201D; tiling of the plane. The book attempts to show that to understand this new type of structure it has been necessary to employ an unusual variety of specialties from mathematics and physics, and that this effort has resulted in new mathematics.</p>
